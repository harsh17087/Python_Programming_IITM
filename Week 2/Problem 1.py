Problem Statement---

Write a Python code to find the quadrant of a point taken as input from the user. The input is
given in 2 lines with the first and second lines representing the x coordinate and y coordinate of
the point respectively. The possible outputs are I, II, III, IV, X-axis, Y-axis, and Origin. Any other
output will not be accepted, Take care of the upper and lower cases while printing the output.
